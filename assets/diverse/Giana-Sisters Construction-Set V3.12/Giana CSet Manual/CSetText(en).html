<h3><a name="Vorwort" id="Vorwort"></a>Preface :</h3>
<br>
First of all: Congratulations that you've just downloaded one of
the best Level-editors available and that you won't even get for
money. ;-)<br>
<br>
I will make it short (at least here) and tell you in which way the
manual is written:<br>
The relevant text is written in normal size, like this, maybe
important things in bold and Head-lines are written bigger the more
important are.<br>
There are also underlined links like this one:<a href=
"Giana-C-Set-Instruction-%28main%29-eng0.80.html#Vorwort">Preface</a>.
Simply click on them to see that point in manual.<br>
<span class="n">Small text, as here are not so important things,
exact information about things that maybe complicating, examples or
other comments.</span><br>
<span class="e">In red are written hints for advanced users or
maybe coders.<br></span><br>
Another hint: In the forth-coming text is mentioned the
Construction-Set or Construction-Kit. The C-Kit means the
level-editor only. C-Set means C-Kit, Game-Maker and the other
important files on disk together.<br>
<br>
Btw, sorry for the mix of English and German words in the C-Set. At
first, it was only supposed for our own use and I entered the words
as they crossed my mind At least the most important things are
written in English and the special in German, but mostly you'll see
what is meant by the graphic and I also translated them as you see
below. Also sorry that there may be a lot of mistakes in the text,
as English is not my native language. <small>(But if you speak
English well and have the time to correct these mistakes with a
html-editor, you're welcome to send me your improved
version.)</small><br>
I hope you have nearly as much fun, as we had as we created the
stages for Giana-Sisters II.<br>
<br>
- Merlin&nbsp; [The 7th Sign] / [The Seven-A-Three]<br>
<br>
<br>
<small>P.S.: If you want to print this manual you have to print the
right frame only. It might be helpful to open the text file only:
"CSetText(en).html".</small><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Auf_der_Disk" id="Auf_der_Disk"></a><br>
<h4>On Disk:</h4>
Die needed tools to create an own Giana-game are right the first 2
files:<br>
"GIANA-CSET V3.0", is the first file, the Construction-Kit, used to
create Stages.<br>
"GIANA GAME-MAKER", the second file is needed to put the stages
together to a complete game.<br>
You can directly load and start these 2 files, all other files
could or must be loaded by them.<br>
"TRAINER" and "GAME PART 2" belong to the Game-Maker, and will by
loaded while using it.<br>
<br>
Then you have 3 tools which doesn't belong to the C-Set but will be
very helpful when you prepare your game-disk:<br>
"FILE-MASTER V1.2" to copy all needed files for your game on the
disk.<br>
"DIR-MASTER V1" to edit the directory. With it you can e.g. put the
files in the desired succession and rename stages to have the
correct number. See also the part: <a href=
"#Der_Game_Maker">Game-Maker</a><br>
"SUPERCRUNCH" is a packer for the Action-Replay-Cartridge only. If
you used the game-maker with it and didn't crunch your game there,
you might better use this one. (see also: Game-Maker)<br>
<br>
Next the load-monsters follow: "01 BIG MBALL.SPR", "01 BIG
MBALL.NLM", "02 FISH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .SPR", "01
FISH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .NLM", "03 INSECT&nbsp;&nbsp; .SPR",
"03 INSECT&nbsp;&nbsp; .NLM", "04 DEMON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .SPR",
"04 DEMON&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .NLM". and so on. More: <a href=
"#32_Nachlademonster">load-monsters</a>. The load-monsters are a
little complicated to handle, but you don't need them for normal
stages.<br>
<br>
These first files are all write-protected, because they MUST stay
on disk ! <small>(Except those 3 tools cause if you know better
ones which do the same, maybe you wanna replace them.)</small><br>
<br>
The following is bonus::<br>
E.g. there are stages from several people that were not suited for
Giana II. So the most of them are not so great, really too
difficult or even not finished. So don't expect too much. Maybe
sometimes a good idea is those stages.<br>
Then follow - as a special bonus - all the Stages of Giana I in a
in a format which can be loaded by the Construction-Set. You could
make a Giana-Sisters I out of them, only with better
collision-requests. Also end-bosses, lives at game-end would score
then. Additionally I corrected some mistakes in these stages.
<span class="n">(Not many, but in some stages extras were set in a
wrong way, so you couldn't get them. - Things that were OK in the
Amiga-version.)</span><br>
Next there are all the 15 treasure-rooms from Giana I + II on the
disk. <span class="n">(As it seems that many people have problems
to create an interesting treasure-room, you may use these, if you
don't have better ideas.)<br>
<big>And finally there are all the old Monsters from Giana I and II
which were replaced by new graphics as load-monsters + 2
Bonus-Sprites.<br>
<br>
P.S.: The Disk is almost full (144 files are maximum). So if you
want to save your stages on it you have to scratch files you don't
need or copy them to another disk.<br></big></span><br>
<a name="Zum_Leveldesign" id="Zum_Leveldesign"></a><br>
<h4>About Level-Design:</h4>
(No need to read this until you seriously start creating stages.)
First of all you should take care that a game is fair, and the
difficulty should raise stage by stage.<br>
I think Giana II is a good example for raising difficulty, though
the beginning maybe a little too hard. And it's not a bad thing to
have easier stages between sometimes. Even if Giana II is not
always fair, there are not too many unfair places, and most of them
can be avoided if you think about. If you think Giana II is too
hard and you want to create an easier game, remind that the stage
usually seems easier to the creator than to other players. Best is,
when you let others test-play it (preferably without giving
hints).<br>
<br>
What you should avoid are e.g. branch-off's where you have to
choose the right path while the wrong one is deadly. You should be
able to get along by using skill and intelligence, not by luck or
by memorizing the right way. It's not too evil if there is a deadly
dead-end sometimes, but better give a small hint for the right way
then. <span class="n">Example: In the middle of stage 31 in Giana
II you have to decide, if going the upper path or the one below.
But it may cross your mind, that the easy path could be wrong.
Additionally, if you walk the wrong path you'll notice that the
bonus-blocks there contain no bonuses, what could make you think
about, and you're able to go back after you hit the first one. Also
if you read the hints for the game (in the intro or on our
web-site), you know that you can get every single diamond in the
game.<br></span> You should also avoid too many invisible walls and
hidden corridors, especially if you die when taking the wrong path.
Also a labyrinth made from these parts is mostly unplayable - even
if you don't die, when you don't know the way. That would be too
much of a guessing game. - A good (negative) example for overdoing
this is the stage "XX MERLIN3&nbsp; .STG". <span class="n">(Also on
the C-Set-Disk) (I didn't built it to the end, after I noticed that
it was totally unplayable.)</span><br>
Anyway, things you may hide very well are bonuses, that are not
needed to accomplish the stage.<br>
<br>
Btw. in Giana-Sisters I it was also possible to collect every
single diamond, without dying. If you do the same is a matter of
taste, of course. I just like it more this way.<br>
<br>
VERY IMPORTANT is this: Take care that you cannot collect 100 or
more diamonds (bonus) in a single stage, because if you run out of
time at the end of a stage, loose a life and start again at the
beginning of the stage, you can get back the life you lost before
by collecting 100 bonus in that stage again. So you could
hypothetically score unlimited points by doing this again and
again. Keep in mind that there are also diamonds in treasure-rooms.
(Those from Giana II contain around 40, more or less) <span class=
"e">If you don't get an extra at the beginning of a stage, you may
even place more than 100 bonus. But only in the case that you have
to be punk at the beginning to get all diamonds. So you can't get
more than 99 after you lost a life.</span><br>
<br>
<br>
HERE'S A LIST ABOUT WHAT WAS CHANGED SINCE GIANA-SISTERS I:<br>
- 1 to 99 Stages are possible<br>
- up to 40 Treasuries (instead of only 5 in Giana I)<br>
- New Sprite-Control-Program (was a huge Part in the Program, done
by Chrille). That means:<br>
&nbsp; - Giana can jump on moving platforms (Elevators)<br>
&nbsp; - Giana can swim in water<br>
&nbsp; - Giana can fly by collecting the Jet-Pack-Extra<br>
&nbsp; - If the maximum of sprites is in the screen one of them can
disappear when a new one comes in (in Giana I no new sprite could
appear in this case). If possible dead sprites will be deleted
first.<br>
&nbsp; - Treasure-Chests which contain the same extras like the
extra-blocks but Giana can collect them without jumping under a
block<br>
&nbsp; - many new small enemies (some of them must be shot 2 or 3
times to kill them) and some new (big) end-bosses<br>
&nbsp; - Some enemies can follow Giana<br>
&nbsp; - Jumping enemies fall down when they loose the ground and
bounce against the ceiling when there is not enough space.<br>
&nbsp; - Some jumping enemies can also jump to the left and to the
right<br>
&nbsp; - Enemies also appear in the first screen (in Giana 1 they
had to scroll in)<br>
&nbsp; - The Dragon spits fire now<br>
&nbsp; - You'll get thousands of points when you kill an
end-monster (instead of nothing :-( in Giana I)<br>
&nbsp; - Softer collision-detection with monsters (in game only,
not in C-Kit/Level-editor)<br>
&nbsp; - Issue (Bug) cleared : Giana won't die any more BEFORE she
touches an enemy (in game only, not in C-Kit)<br>
&nbsp; - Replaced the annoying fast bug/turtle/mouse(whatever) with
a real monster so Giana's Bullet cannot be caught by that
monster<br>
&nbsp; - The exit-elevator has the right look now (not in
multi-color)<br>
&nbsp; - The Bomb-Extra kills all small monsters now (also like
worms or balls) and not only the ones who can also be shot (Who
needs a Bomb when you just as well can shoot the same enemies). But
this won't work for End-Monsters (This would be almost too easy).
(in game only, not in C-Kit)<br>
&nbsp; -Bug cleared: In Giana I the Dragon's head part cannot kill
the player. This won't happen now.<br>
- New Stage-Initialisation-Program (done by Merlin) That means:<br>
&nbsp; - You are able to train a special stage that you already
have played, even without using a cheat<br>
&nbsp; - All stages (and load-monsters) will be loaded from Disk,
so the number of stages is not restricted by the RAM.<br>
&nbsp; - Timelimit can be set different for each Stage between 1
and 9999 seconds<br>
&nbsp; - Warps do not simply teleport Giana 3 Stages forward but
also less or more<br>
&nbsp; - Diamonds (and some other objects) have different colours
in different Stages<br>
&nbsp; - You can make special settings for single stages, e.g. walk
on clouds<br>
- Faster and shorter scroll-routine (by Merlin)<br>
- Also fixed an issue (bug) in the scroll-routine that made Giana
slip from an edge when she just landed on it while scrolling<br>
- New Stage-Build-up-Routine (by Merlin)<br>
- New objects like new walls or upside down turned peaks<br>
- Giana cannot "cheat" any more by standing on the red peaks<br>
- hidden corridors, extras, bonus and invisible bridges are
possible<br>
- start with 5 Lives instead of 3<br>
- You can always view the high-score-list by pressing "H" in the
Title-Screen<br>
- Also the hidden Song of Giana-Sisters can be used
(graveyard-music)<br>
<br>

<h4>What to do with self-made Stages:</h4>
If you want to provide your self-made stages for public, feel free
to send them to me (Merlin). (E-Mail:
SoulBladeGottNr1(at=)gmx.de)<br>
Maybe in the future I will have a website where I can provide the
best for download <small>(Site name maybe: The7thsign.de)</small>.
It doesn't has to be a complete game at once, single stages could
even be more&nbsp; interesting, because if we get enough we could
put them together to a game and the more stage-designers the more
variety. Quality is better than quantity.<br>

<br>
Here, all immovable objects (e.g. earth, walls, trees, fire, exit
...) are placed in a stage.<br>
Placing an object or a group of the same object will be done in
three steps :<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>1.</big> Choose an
object</span><br>
First choose an object by using the joystick <span class=
"n">(Port2)</span>. Push right/left to shift in single steps
previous/next or push the joystick up/down for steps of 16. (All
object numbers hexadecimal) The object is shown in the middle of
the menu. Name, number and size (in 8x8 pixel characters) are on
the left.<br>
Address and Pos are shown on the right - see also <a href=
"#Main_Menu">Main Menu.</a><br>
<br>
Here the same&nbsp; <a href="#Hot-Keys_im_Main_Menu">hot-keys as in
main menu</a> are valid plus "Ctrl" + "d" to erase the last placed
object. But beware, press it just SHORTLY, otherwise you erase the
next ones also.<span class="n">("Ctrl" is on the tab-key in most
C64-emulators.)</span><br>
"Ctrl + "Clr/Home" erases the whole stage !!!<br>
<br>
The objects you can choose here speak for themselves, but if you
want to be sure or wonder how to place the border pieces next to
walls or build an exit from several pieces, you'll find the
descriptions further below under <a href=
"#Objektbeschreibungen">Object descriptions</a>.<br>
If you choose "end stage" here (No. FF) you'll return to the main

Between no.46 (stone) and no.FF (end stage) there is an option
"DELETE ANY OBJECT" (without no.), to delete a single (or several)
objects. Read more about it <a href=
"#XX_Delete_any_Objekt">here</a>. Otherwise choose the piece you
want to foul the area with and press FIRE.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>2.</big> place object on a
position</span><br>
Then you can place the object with the joystick on any location of
the stage. <span class="n">(Maybe scroll with the other joystick or
"," and ".")</span><br>
Press FIRE when the piece is in the desired position.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>3.</big> Extend object to the
right and/or down</span><br>
Since it would be extremely crappy to place every piece on it's
own, you can extend the object to the right and down with objects
of the same type <span class="n">(like this you can build a line of
walls, for example)</span> by pushing the joystick to the right or
down. Joystick to the left or up shortens it again.<br>
Please consider that you can't extend an object up or left. The
object placed in step 2 is always the upper left of a group.<br>
If you are finished extending, press FIRE and choose the next
object as in step 1.<br>

<h4><a name="Objektbeschreibungen" id=

(Some objects look different from the game: e.g. No. 03 Wall with
stone has an "S" on it, or No. 30 Exit wall is blue underlaid. That
is in order that you can tell one object from another in the
construction phase that would look the same in the game.) (As in
the program, the german object-names are displayed, I wrote them in
brackets behind the english words.)<br>

ATTENTION: In the C-Kit you can't test Stages with treasuries as
usual, because if you enter one it appears the first screen of your
stage as a treasury. This way it could happen that your way to the
exit-elevator is blocked. Then you can only press "Restore".<br>
Best is if you test your stage without a treasure room entrance and
build it in when you finished testing.<br>
<small>Usually you don't even need to enter a treasury during
testing. The only exception would be if you can't get ahead without
(e.g. if you need it as a bridgeover for a too far jump). In this
case you could temporarily set a crumbling platform (No.07) on top
of the entrance or change the starting screen to make the elevator
reachable and delete these changes when you finished
testing.</small></td>

<td colspan="7" rowspan="1">If you use the dungeon walls, you will
notice that the left and right borders look very abrupt. You can
solve that problem, if you use border parts. The sheer mass of
objects needed for this can be confusing, so I describe the system,
how the objects are named.<br>
<br>
Every type of a dungeon wall has a number in its name. <span class=
"n">(The number simply stands for the first stage in Giana II,
where that wall appears..)</span> You can find this number also in
the name of the matching border parts. For every type of a wall
there are four different border parts: L1, R1, L2 or R2 are
therefore added to the name. L stands for left and R for right.<br>
The border parts L1 and R1 are put left and right directly
alongside the wall and widen them for 1 square.<br>
The border parts L2 and R2 are put left and right directly on the
border of the wall, which doesn't get wider, of course.<br>
<br>
An exception is dungeon wall 01, which needs only one type of
border parts, which are placed only on the left side and can be
placed on or alongside the wall.<br>

<h2>Set Sprites :</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here all movable objects (Sprites) are set in a stage, mostly
monsters, but also extras and elevators.<br>
Similar to "Create Stage" you can push joystick left/right to
choose a sprite. (Joystick up = select "Delete Sprite" / Joystick
down = select "End with Sprites") Then press FIRE, move the sprite
to the desired position in level and press FIRE again to select the
next one.<br>
(here is a little bug in the program: Sprites, which are set in the
first screen, appear in gameplay 1 character (8 pixels) to the left
from the spot where they were set in construction-part. To solve
this problem, just set the sprites in the first screen 1 char.
further to the right. In the rest of the level (X-Pos 28 and
higher) the sprites will appear, where they've been set.)<br>
<br>
HOT-Keys: Commodore-key + "Clr/Home" = delete all Sprites
<span class="n">(In emulator usually: "Ctrl"+"Pos1")</span>.
Otherwise the same <a href="#Hot-Keys_im_Main_Menu">Hot-Keys as in
Main Menu</a> are valid.<br>
<br>
Choose "End with Sprites" to return to Main Menu.<br>
<br>
<a name="Delete_Sprite" id="Delete_Sprite"></a>Choose "Delete
Sprite" to delete a single sprite in the stage. After pressing FIRE
a Cursor will appear. Move it on the sprite you want to erase and
press FIRE .<br>
At big sprites (actually put together by 2-4 connected sprites,
e.g. end-bosses) move the cursor on the left sprite. Here is also a
small bug: If another sprite has the same X-pos. as the one you
want to delete <span class="n">(one up on the other)</span> the
latter set will be deleted, so you can also place the cursor above
or below the sprite. <span class="n">(This is a relic from old
times, because the old Giana-I-program didn't allow to set one
sprite up on the other.)</span><br>
<br>
Better don't set more than 4 sprites inside one screen, cause it
can happen that some of them disappear during game-play
<span class="n">(as 4 of the 8 C64-Sprites are used for Giana and
her bullet)</span>.<br>
For the same reason you better use big monsters (consisting of
several sprites) at the end of a stage, <small>respectively if no
more sprites will appear. Otherwise these will be destroyed and it
looks buggy then. (Feel free to test it.) Additionally these
enemies will usually come back after the have left the screen. The
spider is possible, if there are not more than 2 other sprites on
screen.</small><br>

extra-sprites, but these will always look the same. E.g. if you
placed a lightning then always the lightning will appear, not
another extra in the succession.<br>

Better place it in a way that it doesn't directly run into the
player, cause you have nearly no time to react. <small>(I think
stages, which you have to play several times to know where the save
places are, are poor. - This is Giana-Sisters, not Rick Dangerous -

<td>What sprite is displayed here depends on which one you loaded
in memory at "Load Menu" then "Load Load-Monster or Sprite". You
can also load it <small>(in Load Menu)</small> at "Directory and
Load from Directory" where you can select it from the directory by
joystick. <small>(It takes a little time to load. During this time
the screen could look buggy. But that's ok, so don't be irritated.
The program didn't crash!)<br></small> The file-names end with
".NLM" oder ".SPR". <span class="e">".NLM" contains the
attribute-data of a monster/sprite. ".SPR" contains the graphic for
its sprites. You can even create your own monsters with own
graphics, but that's complicated. Read more at <a href=
"#Nachlademonster_kreieren">Create load-monster</a>.</span><br>
When you select such a file, the ending doesn't matter, cause both
will be loaded, that means the complete monster/sprite-data.
<small>(Example: If you choose the file "02
FISH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .NLM" it and "02
FISH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .SPR" will be loaded.)<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT: If you want to set a loading-monster in your stage you
have to set the number for it at "Options". The number is equal to
the first 2 Characters of&nbsp; the proper file-name.
<small>(Example: If you want the insect as end-boss and loaded "03
INSECT&nbsp;&nbsp; .NLM" you have to set "Nachlademonster" to 03 at
"options".)</small> This MUST be set if you want to use the stage
in a game to make the correct enemy appear. Set "Nachlademonster" =
NO if no load-monster is needed.&nbsp; <small>[P.S.: If you load a
self-made stage to the Construction Kit, you still have to load the
proper load moster (, if you want to test-play). This works
automatically in the game (, that's what the value in options is
for).]</small><br>

<h2><a name="Set_Startpoints" id="Set_Startpoints"></a>Set
Startpoints :</h2>
<br>
Here Giana's starting-positions for both halves of the stage are
set.<br>
If you choose this menu-item, Giana will appear on screen and you
can move her to the desired position, by using the joystick. Then
press FIRE and do the same for the second starting position.<br>
<br>
The X-position should be between 17 and 9A, to prevent problems.
Y-position doesn't matter.<br>
&nbsp; <span class="n">The X-position can be set pixel by pixel,
the Y-position character by character (8 pixel-steps) (cause Giana
should stand up on a char. and not half way in it.)<br>
Luckily the program prevents, that you set Giana on a too high or
too low position (that she would crash immediately), but you could
place her too far to the left or right. (If X-pos. is below 0F she
is stuck in the left screen-border. Better set it at least to 17.)
Also avoid to set her too far to the right (X-pos &gt; FA = Error).
Additionally the screen normally begins to scroll at X-pos. &gt;
9A, so in this case the screen scrolls later, and you see less at
the right. Although it will be normal after walking once to the
left, it may cause other problems. Like it is in stage 1 of Giana
II: Here the starting-position is too far to the right, and if you
walk left and right a little, the left screen-part has scrolled
out, which was the only way out and you're captured.</span><br>
<br>
Unfortunately no other sprites are displayed, while you set the
starting position. So you have to take care, that you don't set her
on a monster by mistake. But you'll finally notice that during
test-play. It can also be a little annoying if you want to start on
an elevator. If so, you have to remember the position of the
elevator, and maybe try around a little.<br>

<h2><a name="Play_Stage" id="Play_Stage"></a>Play Stage :</h2>
<br>
Did you put enough stuff to the stage where Giana can walk on or
maybe created a hard-as-hell-level already and want to know if you
can beat it?<br>
So here you can test-play your stage. Everything behaves like in a
real game. (There are just a few&nbsp; <a style=

Unfortunately you can play it only once as a treasury, because it
stays in memory as you leave it. I.e. if you play it a second time
you'll miss diamonds and other things. But you can simply press
"Restore" and choose "Play Stage" again..</td>

<h4><a name="Unterschiede_zwischen_Play_Stage_und" id=
"Unterschiede_zwischen_Play_Stage_und"></a> Differences between
"Play Stage" and a constructed game :</h4>
<big>1.</big> Sprite-collision-detection is harder than it is in
the game. While you can slightly touch the monsters in a game, in
the C-kit the collision is at least pixel-exact.<span class=
"n">(Unfortunately you'll die sometimes even before you touch an
enemy like in Giana I, this happens if some sprites in the screen
are overlapping.)<br>
But anyway it's better, not to create a stage that you can only
accomplish because of&nbsp; a few pixels more tolerance. In this
way it's a good test and you can definitely accomplish the stage in
the game if you made it here. (Primarily the collision is harder,
because it was like this in Giana I and I didn't transfer some of
the not-so-important program-parts from Giana II to the
construction-kit, also like the next point.)</span><br>
<br>
<big>2.</big> If you have the bomb-extra and activate it by using
"Space" you can only kill monsters that can be killed by 1 hit
(like it was in Giana I).<br>
In Giana II and in self-made games you can kill every monster
(except end-bosses) with it, also like worms, balls, etc.<br>
<span class="e">End-bosses are all monsters, that can suffer more
than 4 shots, but not "immortal" ones.</span><br>
<br>
<a name="Fahrstuhlbug" id="Fahrstuhlbug"></a><big>3.</big>
Exit-elevator-bug: In the C-kit the exit-elevator (sprite no.16)
often doesn't work properly. It may happen that the elevator dies
if you you jump on it, also Giana could die. or some of its sprites
are missing.<br>
Fortunately this is not a big problem during test-playing the
stage, cause you can simply press "Return" to accomplish it.<br>
In a self-made game this will be ok, of course.<br>
<br>
<big>4.</big> When Giana swims or flies, she doesn't look like a
punk <small>(in the C-Kit)</small> even if&nbsp; she has the
abilities already. <small>(This way it was in Giana II,
too.)</small> But now, for your self-made games it was improved, so
Giana will always have the right look there.<br>
<br>
<big>5.</big> When you enter a treasury in the C-Kit the first
screen of your stage will appear, see <a href="#treasury">object
no. 17 Treasure room entrance</a>.<br>
<br>
<span class="n">P.S.: You may wonder, why objects like diamonds,
bonus-blocks, fire, etc. are not animated like it is in a game, or
why there's no sound and music. There's a simple reason for it:
Lack of memory!<br></span><br>

If you choose this point a sub-menu will appear and provides the
forthcoming choices for you:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h4><a name="Directory_and" id="Directory_and"></a>Directory and
load from Directory:</h4>
The most important menu-item here, as you can select stages and
<a href="#32_Nachlademonster">loading-monsters</a> directly in the
directory and load them.<br>
After selecting this menu-item, it takes a little time until
directory is loaded. The screen may look a little buggy during
loading-time, but it's nothing worse and the directory will be
displayed on screen after some time.<br>
Now you may choose a stage-file by using the joystick and load it
into the memory. Or choose a file with the ending ".NLM" or ".SPR"
to load a&nbsp; <a href="#32_Nachlademonster">load-monster</a> .
(If so, stage-data stays in memory, of course.)<br>
<span class="e">Btw., it's not possible that you load a to big file
by mistake, which would overwrite important data and make the
program crash. Too big files will be detected by the program and it
returns to the main menu. Even if you load a file that doesn't
contain stage-data, most times the program won't crash <span class=
"n">(,only the stage will look crappy probably)</span>.</span><br>
If you just want to view the directory, and don't want to load a
file, simply press "Space" to return to Main Menu.<br>
<br>
At this (and the next) point it's also possible to load stages 
created by the old C-Kit from Sandy/Prof. Knibble and those from 
the "New-Wave"-Giana 2.<br>
<span class="n">Attention: Maybe such Stages have to be adjusted 
for some reason. E.g: Originally there couldn't appear monsters in 
the 2nd start-screen.<br>
Stages from our (The 7A3) Giana II can't be loaded for technical 
reasons.</span><br>
<br>
<br>

Since stage-files which have been saved by the C-Set are always 16 
Characters in length they are here, too. Even if they end with 
spaces.<br>
If you want to load files with shorter name for some reason (maybe 
different format) type "*" behind the name.</span><br>

<span class="e">Tipp: If you don't know the file-name exactly, but
the number of the loadmonster, you may enter e.g.
"01??????????.NML" to load the load-monster with no. 01 cause each

program.</span><br>

<h1><a name="Der_Game_Maker" id="Der_Game_Maker"></a>The Game-Maker
:</h1>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When you have enough stages, you can put them together and make a
complete game out of them.<br>
At first you load the Giana Game-Maker, that should be listed in
the directory directly below the C-Kit. With it you can create a
game-file that will contain the game-program, a title-screen and
the treasuries. All other stages will be loaded by that game-file
(more about this later).<br>
<br>
Before telling you how to generate the game-file <span class=
"n">(which is easy, so you may not need an explanation)</span>,
firstly the <b>most important</b>:<br>
The game file has to be on a disk together with your stages and the
required load-monsters. To adjust, how many stages or in which
order they appear is not very complicated, luckily. You just have
to choose the proper file-names for your stages:<br>
As the stages, which you save with the C-Kit have names like
"XX&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .STG" you
just have to change "XX" to the number of which stage it will be in
the game. Numbers from "01" to "99" are allowed. Anyway, the ending
".STG" must stay as it is. Between that you may key in any
character. (Maybe you wanna give names to your stages, to keep them
apart more easily.)<br>
<br>
How to generate the game-file:<br>
Having loaded and started the Game-Maker the message "ENTER TEXT
FOR TITLE-SCREEN" appears. Here you can enter a text that will
appear in the top line of your title screen, e.g. the name of your
game. <small>(or you can simply press "Return" to keep the default
text.)</small><br>
<br>
Next the message "INSERT YOUR STAGE-DISK AND PRESS FIRE IN PORT 2"
appears.<br>
The disk you insert then should contain the treasuries for your
game and a title-screen <span class="n">(Title-screen means the
stage that</span> <span class="n">repetitively</span> <span class=
"n">scrolls through the screen after you've started the game, right
before you can start playing.)</span>, although you can do it
without title-stage. <span class="n">(If so, the part of the screen
where the title-stage scrolls is simply black.)<br></span> Btw.,
the C-set-disk contains all the treasure-rooms of Giana I + II
<span class="n">(file-ending ".TRA")</span>, that you may use for
your game if you have no good ideas for own treasuries. Also on
disk: The title-stage from Giana I <span class="n">(file-name: "TI
GIANA I&nbsp; .STG")</span>.<br>
After inserting the proper disk press FIRE on joystick in port 2
and the directory will be loaded which may take some time depending
on its size.<br>
<br>
When directory is loaded it will be displayed on screen and you can
scroll it up/down by using the joystick.<br>
At the bottom of the screen the message "SELECT YOUR TITLESCREEN
AND PRESS FIRE OR SPACE IF YOU WANT A BLACK SCREEN" will be
displayed. So move the stage that you want for the title on the
white selection-bar and press FIRE (or "Space" if you don't want a
title).<br>
<br>
Next the message "SELECT TREASURY TO LOAD OR PRESS SPACE WHEN YOU
HAVE ENOUGH" will appear.<br>
That means you have to select your first treasure-room and press
FIRE, after that select the 2nd one in the same way, then the 3rd
and so on.<br>
As soon as you have included enough treasuries press "Space". Right
at the bottom of the screen "NUMBER OF TREASURIES" shows how many
you got already. (You need at least one treasury for a game. The
maximum amount of treasuries is only restricted by the memory, so
around 20 or 30 should be no problem.)<br>
<br>
After that the directory-display vanishes and you have to do some
final adjustments at the following prompts :<br>
<ol>
<li>"ENTER LAST STAGE POSSIBLE TO PLAY IN TRAINERMODE : " (enter a
2-digit number)<br>
If you don't know exactly what the trainer-mode is (it's not a
cheat, it's rather for practice) read this:<br>
<span class="n">If you have played a game for a while and restart
playing you can choose a single stage that you want to play with
unlimited lifes. This is possible from stage 1 to the highest stage
you have reached before. But you can play only the selected stage
over and over and train/practice it this way. To quit just press
"Restore" and you return to the title-screen.</span><br>
The highest stage that is available in trainer-mode should be the
one before the last (the stage that contains the huge magic
diamond), because if you would collect the huge diamond in the
trainermode, it would be like you've accomplished the game and you
could enter a high-score - that wouldn't be fair, of course.</li>
<li>"MAKE SOME STAGES SPECIAL ?" (enter: "Y" or "N")<br>
Press "Y" if&nbsp; you want to do some special adjustments for
chosen stages. (E.g. walk on clouds, different colors for some
objects or if the dragon follows Giana...) Anyway, this is not
needed and you may press "N" if all your stages should be played in
the regular way and it goes on with point 3.<br>
The forthcoming sub-points show what you can adjust here: (enter a
2-digit number at each point) <small>(If there's an option you
don't wanna use, type in 00 for the stage.)</small><br>
<ol>
<li>"LAVA INSTEAD OF WATER IN STAGE :"<br>
Enter the number of the stage where the water is displayed in red
color, so it looks like lava.</li>
<li>"WHITE PEAKS I. STG :"<br>
In the stage you key in the usually red spikes are displayed in
white.</li>
<li>"WALK ON CLOUDS I. S."<br>
Here you enter in which stage giana can walk on clouds. (like in
Giana II, Stage 33) You should take care that there are no clouds
above the stage. Otherwise you could walk therere, too, which would
be confusing. So set clouds (Wolken) = "N" in options of C-kit for
this stage.</li>
<li>"TREASURY-ENTRANCE AS STAGE-EXIT :"<br>
Enter a stage where you enter the next stage instead of a
treasureroom when you jump into the treasure-room-entrance (object
no.17) (Like in Giana I, Stage 32 or Giana II, Stage 33)</li>
<li>"DRAGON FOLLOWS :"<br>
Enter the stage where the dragon (sprite no.14) follows Giana to
the left and right (like in Giana I, Stage 33 ; Giana II, Stage
39). The dragon with this attribute can also suffer 10 more shots
than the normal one and appears in another color.</li>
<li>"CYAN AS 3RD COLOR FOR DUNGEONWALL 99 :"<br>
Here you can set the 3rd multi-color for dungeon-wall to cyan for a
single stage. So it looks better if you combine it with colors like
blue and light blue. Usually the third multi-color is always yellow
for this wall.</li>
<li>"DIFFERENT TREASURYENTR.COLOR I S :"<br>
Change the color of the treasure-room-entrance (object no. 17,
normal = blue) for the chosen stage.<br></li>
<li>"COLOR :" Here you enter the color of the
treasure-room-entrance for the stage you entered at the point
before. E.g. you may set it to 00 (black) to make it invisible in a
stage with black background. (Only values from 00 to 07 make
sense.)<br></li>
<li>"2ND STAGE DIFFERENT COLOR :"<br>
Similar to sub-point 7 for a second stage.</li>
<li>"COLOR :" Enter the color for the treasury-entrance for the
stage chosen at 9. <span class="n">You may also enter 01(white) to
hide it at top of water.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>"REPLACE BIRD WITH BEE? (Y/N)" If you press "Y" all the birds
in your game will look like the bee from Giana-Sisters I.
<small>(There's no difference in their
characteristics.)</small><br></li>
<li>"MAKE A TRAINERVERSION ? (Y/N)"<br>
Press "Y" to allow cheating in your self-made game.<br>
Anyway, High-Scores cannot be saved if s.o. uses the cheat.</li>
<li>"PRE-CRUNCH PROGRAM ?" ....."(Y/N)"<br>
Here you decide if the game that you have generated by your former
inputs, should be packed already before saving it.<br>
ATTENTION: You have to pack it, as long as you don't use a
cartridge that is able to save the RAM at $D000 -$FFFF.<br>
If you use e.g. an Action-Replay-Cartridge it's no problem to press
"N".<br>
But whatever you enter it is possible to pack it more later by a
usual packer. <span class="n">(The packer that is used here is a
little primitive.)</span></li>
</ol>
<br>
After this you have done all necessary settings and next you'll be
asked to enter a file-name for your game.<br>
Having done that the program loads from the Construction-Set-Disk
once again and then shows the following message :<br>
"INSERT SAVE-DISK AND PRESS FIRE".<br>
So you insert a disk on which you want to save your game
<span class="n">(you need at least 190 free blocks on it or 250 if
you didn't pack)</span> and press FIRE.<br>
Now the game will be saved (maybe packed before) and the program
exits.<br>
<br>
That's it! Now you have made your own Giana-game. Have much fun
playing it or maybe watching other players how they find it a
really hard nut to crack. <span class="n">(But remind, you should
be able to accomplish your own game, of course.)</span><br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.: Under the game-maker files is the file "HI!", which contains
a default high score table,so you can't enter the high score with a
too low score. You can copy it to your game-disk as well but you
don't have to. If you don't you have an empty high-score and a new
"HI!"-file will be saved after entering the high score table for
the first time.<br>

<h2><a name="Das_Programm:" id="Das_Programm:"></a>The
Program:</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The following chapter is for advanced users and coders who want
more possibilities as the C-Set has to offer.<br>
At first a rather simple thing: It is described how to create your
own load-monsters. For this you just have to enter a few bytes and
get proper sprite-graphics.<br>
Later I will roughly tell about the program and memory-structure to
give you a clue where to find data and program-parts that you
possibly want to change.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3><a name="Nachlademonster_kreieren" id=
"Nachlademonster_kreieren"></a>Create load-monsters:</h3>
<br>
<br>
Firstly you have to build a file that contains the sprite-grafix.
(12 Sprites is maximum) The filename must begin with the
2-digit-number of the load-monster and has to end with ".SPR".<br>
<br>
2ndly and latterly you have to build a file with the same number
and the ending "NML" which contains the monsters attributes. These
are 21 bytes only. (or more for monsters that move in a fixed way,
more of it later).<br>
<br>
They have the following meaning: <span class="n">(The bytes are
numbered in hexadecimal)</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(102, 0, 0);">Recommendation: As these data
are built up in a relatively complicated way and some of the values
have more than 1 meaning, I suggest to view the Sprite-data of the
existing monsters and sprites. So you may look at data of sprites
with attributes&nbsp; you already know about, and understand it
better this way.</span><br>

<big style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"><a name=
"Animationsphaseninstuktion" id=
"Animationsphaseninstuktion"></a>*</big> The sprites for one
animation-phase have to be in memory one after another. Sprites for
load-monsters are at $FB80 to $FE80, space for 12 sprites with
numbers from EE to F9 for animation-phase left/right and dead
monster.<br>
For monsters that consist of multiple sprites the sprites of one
animation-phase have to be one after the other in memory, beginning
with the left bottom-sprite <span class="n">(next the left top
sprite, right top, right bottom for 2x2 sprites. If only on top or
besides each other begin with left or bottom sprite.)</span>. At
the sprite-numbers for first and last animation-phase allways enter
the no. of the first sprite from one animation-part.<br>
The sprite-graphics are at the last video-bank at $C000. Each
sprite consists $40 bytes (decimal: 64). So the address of the
graphic is $C000 + $40 * Sprite-No.<br>
Btw, an Action-Replay-Cartridge is extremely helpful to view, load
and save sprites. (in freezer-menu: View Sprites)<br>
<br>
The "*.NML"-file should saved at $7505, where the load-monsters are
loaded to in C-Kit as also in your game.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="NLM_vorgegebener_Weg" id=
"NLM_vorgegebener_Weg"></a>Load-monsters moving in a fixed
way:</h4>
<br>
<br>
If a Sprite is designed to follow a fixed way, there has to be a
byte-sequence in memory that describes its way. This data consist
of 3-byte-blocks:<br>
<br>
1st Byte: Specifies how often the move that the next 2 bytes
contain will be repeated. The value FF is the end-byte to make the
whole movement repeat, beginning with the first 3-byte-block
again.<br>
2nd Byte: A positive value means how many pixel per 50th part of a
second the sprite moves to the right.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A
negative value means how many pixel per 50th part of a second the
sprite moves to the left. <span class="n">(FF = -1 , FE = -2 ,
...)</span><br>
3rd Byte: A positive value means how many pixel per 50th part of a
second the sprite moves upwards.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A negative value means how many pixel per
50th part of a second the sprite moves downwards. <span class=
"n">(FF = -1 , FE = -2 , ...)</span><br>
<br>
It makes sense to write these movement-data directly behind the
attribute-data at $751A. So set the fixed-way-pointer to this
address.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, all&nbsp; monster-data are assembled in the same way as
the load-monsters. Pointer to their sprite attributes are at $21D8
in a game. <span class="n">[Low-Byte , High-Byte for sprite 0
(bird); Low-Byte , High-Byte for Sprite 1 (gnome) ; ....]</span> If
you want to change them, you have to modify the game itself.<br>

<br>
Here is a rough overview of the memory-map of the game (the file
you generated with the Game-Maker). In the C-Kit the memory is
partially build up in the same way, but there are also parts that
stand at totally different addresses, mostly program-parts. Also
the C-Kit practically contains 2 very different programs, one for
editing and one for playing a stage.<br>
Text-data are all in character-code, except some exceptions in
ASCII which are labelled so.<br>

<h3><a name="Stage-Aufbau_im_Speicher_:" id=
"Stage-Aufbau_im_Speicher_:"></a>Stage-assembling in memory :</h3>
<br>
<br>
As you know, when you built a stage in the C-kit it works in 3
steps, where the following things are defined :<br>
<table class="e" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody style="vertical-align: top;">
<tr style="font-size: smaller;">
<td>st. Byte</td>
<td>2nd Byte</td>
<td>3rd Byte</td>
<td>4th Byte</td>
<td>5th Byte</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Object-No.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
X-Pos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
Y-Pos&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>Number of objects side by side<br></td>
<td>Number of objects on top of each other<br></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br>
These 5 values are in memory in the same order followed by the next
group of 5 and so on until value = FF signals the end of data. They
are in memory at $8400 in the C-kit and in the game at $6E0D (if
it's not a treasurie or the title-stage).<br>
Directly before the data of the first object-group there are $10
bytes for each stage which define its attributes which were set at
options.<br>

Before a stage starts the compact data, assembled in object-groups,
are stored to the correct position in the stage-memory at $AC00.
There the stage is hold as an array of 256 x 20 ($100 x $14)
charakters in char.-code (beginning left at the top to right
below).<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="Aufbau_Sprite-Daten" id=
"Aufbau_Sprite-Daten"></a>Assembling of&nbsp; Sprite-Data:</h4>
<br>
<br>
The sprite-data , that are hold at 8C00 to max. 8D00 in the C-kit
and are transfered behind the stage-data (- that's the reason for
the pinter at 83F6) are built up in a slightly different way.
<span class="n">(As they are set as single objects.)</span> From
this pointer 15F3 will be subtracted because the stage-adress is
that many bytes below as in the C-kit.<br>
<br>
These data are assembled in groups of 3 bytes:<br>
X-Pos inside stage<br>
Y-Pos<br>
No. of Sprite<br>
<br>
The X-pos of the following group has to be equal or bigger than the
one in the former. (Of course the C-Kit-program sorts it.) If the
first byte of a group is = FF, it signals the end of data.<br>
